# Gender and Anthropometric Study: Weight, Length, and Head Circumference

## Overview
This repository contains a case study that evaluates the relationship between gender and various anthropometric measurements, specifically weight, length, and head circumference of babies born at term. The analysis was performed using SPSS, and the study uses a dataset of 256 babies measured at 1 month of age.

## Report
The complete report is available in the data folder
## Analysis
The data was checked for outliers and missing values, followed by tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Q-Q plot) and descriptive statistics. Hypothesis testing was done using t-tests for weight and head circumference, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for length.

## Results Summary
- **Length:** No significant difference between genders.
- **Weight:** Significant difference with a small effect size.
- **Head Circumference:** Significant difference with a large effect size.

## Tools and Techniques
- SPSS for data analysis
- T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for hypothesis testing
- Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk test for checking normality

## Dataset
The dataset contains the weights, heights, and head circumference of babies.
